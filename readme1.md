To start the game, run the java progam:

    edu.siren.Siren

You will be shown the JavaThrowers splash screen. Click on the screen to continue

Next, you are prompted to with the Siren Splash... Again, click enter to continue.

You may choose to create a profile or load an existing profile.

 -- At the time of creation, you will need to pick a sprite. 

The next screen after login is the World Selection or the Item Shop Selection.

In the item Shop, you can place your sprite on the label of the item you wish 
to purchase and then press the key 'e'

You will see the item in the bottom of your screen.

In the Worlds, you can move around and will meet enemies. At some of the enemies
there are other sprites that you can use to help defend. You will be taken to a 
battle map where you will click on your sprite or the other sprite. A Menu will
pop up and you can choose an action from the menu. You click either on the enemy
for attacking or within the red squares to move.

Once you've defeated the enemy, you stats will appear. Click to continue.

You can choose your next world or the Item shop.


Also there was a problem that we didn't get to fix. Switching from worlds is supposed
to save your profile and reload it. But, it's not reloading properly, so you
will have to login with your profile name at each world. Sorry!
